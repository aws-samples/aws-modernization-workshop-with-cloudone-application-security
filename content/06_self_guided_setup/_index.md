# Self-Paced Workshop

Welcome to the Self-Guided Setup section! This workshop requires an AWS account where there is AWS IAM user/identity that has the proper permissions to set up the necessary AWS components for the workshop. Worried about costs associated with this workshop? All good. There’s a page that will allow you to request AWS credits to pay for any costs incurred through this workshop.

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

1. Creating an AWS account with proper permissions
1. Requesting AWS credit from AWS Marketplace
